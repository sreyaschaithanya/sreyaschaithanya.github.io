It has been quite a long hiatus from doing something worthwhile.

A long time ago, along with the songs of tri mandili, the youtube algorithm decided to recommend me this gem of a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o64FV-ez6Gw) by Joel Grus. Naturally,  I made a repo and started to write an ml library from scratch. Annnnnnd I had forgotten about it a week later.

So, this is a try to bring life to the repo and complete the library to a usable level. I will be logging all raw thoughts and reasoning that come into my mind here. Hopefully, it's readable.

Let's set some goals and context for the library:
-	Writing better python, cause I don't think I write good code
-	A little insight into some ml algorithms, a revision is some sense
-	And the most important, having one complete project I can brag about

So with that set aside, what should be the algorithms included:
-	linear regression (duh)
-	classification(logistic, svm, desition tree, bagging, and boosting)
-	NNs (well, it started with this, so I ough to complete this)

Hmmm, it seems doable. So, on with the code.
